# WebTech Workshop
Project developed during a mobile development event organized by PUC Minas. The main objective of this project is to introduce the concept of native iOS application programming with Swift. To achieve this, a to-do list program was created, covering several important introductory concepts, such as creating interfaces with SwiftUI and storing data with UserDefaults.

## üî® Project functionality
The application was developed with the main purpose of being a to-do list. It allows users to view a list of registered tasks, add new tasks, and delete tasks as needed. Additionally, the project includes a location map to put into practice the concepts learned about MapKit.

## üíª Technologies used
* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift): programming language developed by Apple for iOS application development
* [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/): declarative framework for creating user interfaces in Swift
* [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine): customize handling of asynchronous events by combining event-processing operators
* [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/): display map or satellite imagery within your app, call out points of interest, and determine placemark information for map coordinates
* [UserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults): Swift interface for storing small amounts of data persistently
